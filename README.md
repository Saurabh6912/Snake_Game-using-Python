# Snake_Game-using-Python

## Overview
This repository contains a Snake Game implemented in Python using object-oriented programming. 
The game is divided into five classes, each responsible for a specific aspect of the game. 
By breaking down the game into these classes, it becomes more organized, modular, and easier to understand and maintain.

## Classes
* ### Screen class
The Screen class is responsible for creating and managing the game window. It initializes the game screen, 
sets its dimensions, and handles the game loop, which constantly updates the screen to reflect the snake's movements.

* ### Snake class
The Snake class manages the snake's behavior, including its movement, growth, and collision detection. It keeps track of the snake's position and updates it as the game progresses.

* ### Food class
The Food class handles the generation of food items within the game. It ensures that food appears at random locations on the screen and tracks whether the snake has eaten it.

* ### ScoreBoard class
he Scoreboard class keeps track of the player's score and displays it on the screen. It updates the score as the snake consumes food and provides feedback to the player.

* ### Game class
The Game class serves as the entry point for running the game. It imports and initializes all the other classes, orchestrates the game loop, and manages the overall game state.

## Getting Started
* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
* Run the Game class to start the Snake Game.

* **Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction: up, down, left, and right.**
* **Try to eat as much food as possible without running into the walls or colliding with yourself.**

## Output

## Features
* Classic Snake gameplay.
* Modular code structure with separate classes for different functionalities.
* Real-time updating of the score.
* Responsive controls for smooth gameplay.
